1) Implement a solution for bubble sort.

FUNCTION bubbleSort(collection)
   REPEAT UNTIL swapped is FALSE
     SET swapped to false
     FOR i = FIRST ITEM of collection to LAST ITEM of collection - 1
       IF collection[i] > collection[i + 1] THEN
         SET tmp to collection[i]
         SET collection[i] to collection[i + 1]
         SET collection[i + 1] to tmp
         SET swapped to true
       END IF
     END FOR
  END REPEAT

   RETURN collection
 END FUNCTION

2) Write pseudocode for quicksort.

FUNCTION quickSort(collection)
    IF collection length <=1
        RETURN collection
    ELSE
        SET left, right to empty arrays
        SET pivot to last item in collection
        SET length to length of collection

        FOR i = 0 to length -1
            IF collection[i] <= pivot
                PUSH collection[i] to last index of left
            ELSE
                PUSH collection[i] to last index of right
            END IF
        END FOR
        RETURN quickSort(left).concat(pivot, quickSort(right));
    END IF
END FUNCTION

3) We talked about time complexity in a previous checkpoint,
and how to get an idea of the efficiency of an algorithm.
After looking at the pseudocode for the above sorting methods,
identify why merge sort and quick sort are much more efficient
than the others. Walking through each algorithm with a few sample collections may help.

QUICK SORT: 0(n log n)
MERGE SORT: 0(n log n)
BUBBLE SORT - 0(n^2)
SELECTION SORT - 0(n^2)
-Quick Sort loops through the full array only once and use divide
and conquer to sort through the remaining data. Time complexity gets smaller
for each recursive call.
-Merge sort uses similar divide and conquer process. The algorithm doesn't need
to iterate through the whole collection multiple times because items are sorted
in smaller groupings before sorted in the entire collection.

4) All of the sorts addressed in this checkpoint are known
as comparison sorts. Research bucket sort and explain how
it works. What is the ideal input for bucket sort?

Bucket sort  is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the
elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then
sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm,
or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.
The ideal input is uniformly distributed over a range.
