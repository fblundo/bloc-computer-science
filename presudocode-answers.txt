1 )Why do programmers use pseudocode?
They use it in a preliminary stage to translate initial business requirements in functional logic. This allows them to decompose the business request into elementary units,
to be then translated into source code. This way programmers have the freedom to think before writing the actual code. 

2) If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Running pseudocode won't deliver any actual result, but in most cases it would rather return errors. This happens because pseudocode cannot be understood / compiled by
computers as of today. In the future, leveraging NLP technology, it might be possible!  

***Programming Assignment***
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

A1) Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

function greaterNumber(INPUT number 1, INPUT number 2) {

IF number 1 is greater than number 2
   PRINT number 1 
ELSE IF number 2 is greater than number1 
   PRINT number 2 
ELSE 
   PRINT "same number" 
END IF 

A2) Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET i to 1
WHILE i < 100
{
PRINT i 
INCREASE i by 1 
}

A3) Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

phoneBook = [{name: "" , number: ""}, {name: "" , number: ""}, ...]

FOR EACH item of phoneBook {
  search(entry) {
    IF(entry === name)
    PRINT name and number 
    } 
  }
}


Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

A1) Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

function greaterNumber(num1, num2) {
  if (num1 > num2) {
     document.write(num1)
     } 
  else if (num2 > num1) {
     document.write (num2)
     }
  else {
     document.write("same number")
  } 
}


A2) Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

function printNumber() {
   i = 1;
   while (i < 100) {
     document.write(i);
     i++
}


A3) Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

var phoneBook = [{name: "Fede" , number: "1234"}, {name: "Marco" , number: "5678"}]


phoneBook.forEach(search)

function 
search(object) {
  
  if (name === object.name){
  
    document.write(object.name + object.number)
  
    }

}
