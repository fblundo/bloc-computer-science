Provide all code and written answers in a file named algorithms_introduction_answers.txt:
Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:
- Making coffee;
- Washing dishes;
- A choice of your own.
As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?
Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

1) Making Coffee

IF coffeeMaker water level equals null
 THEN add water;
 ELSE IF water level is less than half;
   INCREMENT by one cup for each cup of coffee needed
 ELSE do nothing;
END IF

IF cream is required
  THEN add two tablespoons
  ELSE don't add cream;
END IF

2) Washing dishes

WHILE (dish dirty)
  IF dish equals dirty dish with oil
     THEN
     use brush and special soap to remove oil;
     use water to clean remaining dirt;
     ELSE
     use normal soap and water to clean dirt;
  END IF
END WHILE

FOR dish
  IF (dish equal wet dish)
    hung up the dish
    ELSE
    put the dish in the kitchen cubpoard
  END IF
END FOR

3) Open a safe

IF safe is locked
   THEN
      insert combination
      click ok
      IF combination is correct
        open the safe
      ELSE IF
        check if the combination has been changed by someone else in the family
      END IF
   ELSE
      check who has opened it
      IF nobody answers
         THEN call the police
      ELSE
         take what you need
         close it using the safe code
END IF

2) Name 3 companies who created an algorithm that made them successful
- The online dating site eHarmony has closely guarded its matchmaking algorithm
- The Facebook algorithm is a process that ranks all available posts that can display on a user's News Feed based on how likely that user will have a positive reaction.
- Uber's platform driver <> passenger matching algorithm

3) An efficient algorithm takes less time and less power / resources / memory / CPU to reach a determined goal vs a less efficient algorithm.
