1) What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

The linked list push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end
of a list. Below is pseudocode for a push function for a singly linked list. However, there
is something wrong with it. Submit both an explanation of the bug and a functional
implementation of the method.

Linked list provides the following two advantages over arrays
1) Dynamic size: linked lists can expand and contract their size.
2) Ease of insertion/deletion: while arrays require to create an index for the new item added,
linked lists are unordered lists which make these operations faster

Linked lists have the following drawbacks:
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node.So we cannot do a binary search with linked lists.
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.

2) Come up with a real world example of a linked list.
An example are previous and next page in a web browser: we can access previous and next
url searched in web browser by pressing back and next button since, they are linked as linked list.

You may program the following questions in any language of your choice (JavaScript, Ruby, etc.).

Before beginning to code, write out a plan explaining how to solve the question.

You didn't wrote the explanation of the push bug and how you solved it. Also in the functional
solution test, what is the purpose of you using the newList.createNode(...) method call?

A: The function is wrongly setting the current node to head when head node already exists.
There can only be one head node in a linked list, the starting element. For this reason,
if a head node already exists, the current node should be set to the newly created node,
at the end of the list.

The correct function should read as follows:

FUNCTION push(element)
  CREATE node
  SET node.value TO element
  SET node.next TO null

  IF the head node does not exist
    THEN SET head to node
  ELSE
    SET current to node
  END IF
END FUNCTION

function LinkedList () {
  this.head = null
  this.size = 0
}

LinkedList.prototype = {
  createNode: function(element) {
    return {
      data: element,
      next: null
    }
  },
  push: function(element) {
    var current,
    newNode = this.createNode(element);
    if (this.head == null) {
      this.head = newNode
    }
    else {
      current = this.head
      while(current.next != null) {
        current = current.next
      }
      current.next = newNode
    }
    this.size++
  }
}

let newList = new LinkedList()
newList.push("head node")
newList.push("second node")
newList.push("third node")
console.log(newList)


function LinkedList(){
  this.head = null;
  this.length = 0;
}

LinkedList.prototype = {
  push: function(val){
    var node = {
       value: val,
       next: null
    }

    if(!this.head){
      this.head = node;
      this.length += 1;
      return node;
    }
    else{
      current = this.head;
      while(current.next){
        current = current.next;
      }
      current.next = node;
      this.length += 1;
    }
  }
}
list= new LinkedList()
list.push(5);
list.push(2);
list.push(4);
list.push(5);
list.push(1);

Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
Example
Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
Output: a -> c -> d


function LinkedList(){
  this.head = null;
  this.length = 0;
}

LinkedList.prototype = {
  push: function(val){
    var node = {
       value: val,
       next: null
    }

    if(!this.head){
      this.head = node;
      this.length += 1;
      return node;
    }
    else{
      current = this.head;
      while(current.next){
        current = current.next;
      }
      current.next = node;
      this.length += 1;
    }
  },
removeduplicate: function() {
    var thisNode = this.head;
    while (thisNode != null) {
      var previousNode = thisNode;
      var nextNode = thisNode.next;
      while (nextNode != null) {
        if (thisNode.value == nextNode.value) {
          previousNode.next = nextNode.next;
          this.length --;
        } else {
          previousNode = nextNode;
        }
        nextNode = nextNode.next;
      }
      thisNode = thisNode.next;
    }
    return this;
  }
}
list= new LinkedList()
list.push("a");
list.push("c");
list.push("d");
list.push("d");
list.push("a");
list.removeduplicate()
console.log(list);


Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
Example
Input: a -> b -> c -> d
Output: d -> c -> b -> a

let list = {
  value: "1",
  next: {
    value: "2",
    next: {
      value: "3",
      next: {
        value: "4",
        next: {
          value: "5",
          next: null
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

function reverseList(list) {
  let node = list
  let previous = null

  while(node != null) {
    // set nodeNext to selext the first node in the list
    let nodeNext = node.next
    // set node.next to be null, since previous = null
    node.next = previous
    // set previous to be node (while node.next remains null)
    previous = node
    //set note to be the next nodeNext to be processed in the loop
    node = nodeNext
  }
  //return previous as the new node
  //as the loop continues, all nodes are reversed
  return previous
}
console.log(reverseList(list))
