Short Answer

1) What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
When you are looking for a brand of cereals at the supermarket, you go through the shelf, searching through all the different boxes,
as if it was an arrayay

2) What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
When you are searching a specific artist in a sorted list on Spotify, or when you search a file in a sorted list of files

3) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
7 iterations

4) Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
3 iterations

5) Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
I would go for a linear search algorithm

6) Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
I would go for a binary search algorithm

Programming Assignment:
- You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross"
in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

var names = ["Albatross", "Dog", "Monkey"; "Zebra"];

function WordFinder(array, word){
  var low = array[0];
  var high = array[array.length -1];

  while (low <= high) {
    var mid = (array.indexOf(low) + array.indexOf(high)) / 2;
    mid = Math.round(mid);

    if(array[mid] > word) {
      high = array[mid -1];
    }
    else if (array[mid] < word) {
      low = array[mid + 1];
    }
    else {
      return array[mid];
    }
  }
  return "The name is not in the list";
}

console.log(WordFinder(names, "Albatross"));

- You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted
goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

var fishTank = ["goldfish", "whitespottedgoldfish", "whitefish", "bluefish"];

function CatchFish(arr, target){
  for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i] === target){
      return "You've net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank";
    }
  }
  return "The only white-spotted goldfish isn't in the tank .";
}

console.log(CatchFish(fishTank, "whitespottedgoldfish"));
